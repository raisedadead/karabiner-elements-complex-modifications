# Karabiner-Elements Complex Modifications for macOS

> My custom complex modifications for [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) on macOS.

### Available Modifications:

1. Swap ["Compose a new email message with a link to the current page"](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/157179?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop#zippy=%2Cgoogle-chrome-feature-shortcuts%2Cwebpage-shortcuts) on Google Chrome to "Open Developer Tools".
   
    This is a really annoying feature. I don't want to use it and have since swapped it to open the developer tools instead.
